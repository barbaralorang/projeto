					<h2>Sobre a Universidade</h2>
					<p>
						First of all, this is a dummy site for site building knowledge test. Unes is a higher education institution that, on a daily basis, produces and disseminates knowledge that serves life. It is worth noting that there are many postgraduate courses that are taught in English as well. In this case, it is necessary to prove proficiency through exams. The deadline is also usually until February for applications. The university has a specific tool to help graduate students interested in studying there.
					</p>

<p>
						Unesp is a fictional college company. The university student will have to adapt to a series of routines and activities, focusing their efforts on meeting the demands of higher education, which may require some reorganization of the daily life they had before entering college. In addition to studying, the development of new skills requires practical activities, such as classes, internships and technical visits, which, for the most part, are offered or directed by the university itself.
